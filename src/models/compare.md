# COMPARE LINEAR REGRESSION AND LOGISTIC REGRESSION 
|    Linear Regression    |    Logistic Regression    |
|:------------------------|:--------------------------|
| Used to predict the continuous dependent variable using a given set of independent variables | Used to predict the categorical dependent variable using a given set of independent variables. |
| The output can take any value between the range of the dependent variable | The outputs produced must be Categorical values such as 0 or 1, Yes or No. |
| The relationship between the dependent variable and independent variable must be linear. | The relationship DOES NOT need to be linear between the dependent and independent variables. |
| Used for solving Regression problems. | Used for solving Classification problems. |
| We are finding and using the line of best fit to help us easily predict outputs. | We are using the S-curve (Sigmoid) to help us classify predicted outputs. |
| Least square estimation method is used for the estimation of accuracy. | Maximum likelihood estimation method is used for the estimation of accuracy. |
| There is a possibility of collinearity between the independent variables. | There should not be any collinearity between the independent variable. |
